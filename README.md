# Amazon Products Analysis ðŸ›’

## Project Overview
This project explores and cleans an **Amazon products sales dataset** (42k items) to prepare it for analysis. The focus is on **data cleaning, normalization, and parsing complex fields** such as price, reviews, delivery details, and sustainability badges.  

The goal is to demonstrate hands-on skills in **Python, Pandas, regex parsing, and Jupyter notebooks**, while extracting actionable insights relevant to business decision-making.

## Key Insights
- **Top Selling Products:** Batteries, calculators, and office supplies dominate â†’ Consider targeted promotions or bundle deals for high-demand items.  
- **Price vs Units Bought:** Products priced $0â€“$20 have the highest sales â†’ Potential to optimize marketing for low-priced items; reevaluate strategies for higher-priced items.  
- **Delivery Trends:** Mondays see the highest delivery volumes â†’ Useful for inventory and logistics planning.  
- **Reviews vs Units Bought:** Moderate positive correlation (Pearson = 0.46) â†’ Products with more reviews generally sell more; encourages review solicitation.  
- **Best Sellers:** Attract more reviews and higher engagement â†’ Highlight top products in promotions.  
- **On Sale vs Full Price:** On-sale items have slightly higher median units sold (5,000 vs 3,000) â†’ Strategic discounting increases engagement.  
- **Sustainability Badges:** Products with strong badges drive higher sales â†’ Sustainability may influence purchase decisions.

## Steps Performed
1. **Download & load dataset** using KaggleHub.  
2. **Normalize numeric fields**: ratings, number of reviews, units sold, prices.  
3. **Convert categorical fields**: Best seller / Sponsored â†’ Boolean.  
4. **Parse coupon values**.  
5. **Extract delivery information**: delivery cost, free delivery, estimated & fastest delivery dates, weekday.  
6. **Clean sustainability badges**.  
7. **Convert collected_at column to datetime**.  
8. **Save cleaned dataset**: full dataset (local) and sample dataset for GitHub.
